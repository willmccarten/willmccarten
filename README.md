# Hello! I am **Will McCarten**! 
 
 I am a fourth year computer science student at the University of Florida, with an _expected graduation of December of 2024_. I am currently in search of an **software engineering full time position starting in 2024**.
 
 I’m interested in just about anything technology related. I feel that I am really moldable, as I have not had too much experience yet and am open to any type of development or area within Computer Science. I am excited to learn as much as I can. If I had to chose, right now I would say my main interest lies with web and mobile apps, games, and really any program that 
 a user will interact with. I enjoy both frontend and backend. 
 
 Outside of schooling and work, my I spend my time outside hiking and playing sports with friends. I am also very interested in Photography.
 
Most of my programming experience is in **Java** and **C++**

Right now, I am actively studying web developement, focusing on **JavaScript**, **React**, **HTML & CSS**
 
 Recently I have been learning about **User Experience Design** and **Human-Computer Interaction**. I would like to continue studying this and incorporate it into my work more.
    
 I’m currently working an internship at Stratos Energy Services in Dublin, Ireland! I am an intern development team lead and outside of that focus on UX and frontend development.

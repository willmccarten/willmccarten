# Hello! I am **Will McCarten**! 
 
I am a recently graudated computer science bachelors student at the University of Florida, and incoming Masters of CS student at Georgia Tech for fall 2025. 
Since graduation, I have been working a role as an **associate product manager** at _American Express_ in New York City!

My interests are spread around in the technology space. Within Computer Science my current interests are within Human-Computer Interaction and User Experience Design. Despite going into product management out of college, I intend to continue working on software projects and hopefully post them here on github. 
 
Outside of schooling and work, my I spend my time outside, hiking and playing sports with friends, as well as doing photography.
 
Most of my programming experience is with **ReactJS**, **Python**, **Java**, and **C++**

Right now, I am actively working on small user applications for iOS and MacOS. I want to try to better combine my interests with coding projects. Soon I look to incorporate my loves for music, photography, and nature into something. Stay tuned for that I suppose. 

I think I will continue working in the mobile space for my next few projects and want to learn a platform-specific technology like Swift or Kotlin. If you have suggests or insight, please reach out to me below.
    
 My last job expreience was working an internship at Stratos Energy Services in Dublin, Ireland! I was an intern development team lead and outside of that focus on UX and frontend development.

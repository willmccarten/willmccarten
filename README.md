# Hello! I am **Will McCarten**! 
 
 I am a senior computer science student at the University of Florida,  _graudating on December 14th, 2024_. I am an incoming **product manager** at _American Express_.

My interests are spread around in the technology space. Within Computer Science my current interests are within Human-Computer Interaction and User Experience Design. Despite going into product management out of college, I intend to continue working on software projects and hopefully post them here on github. I am hoping to enroll in Georgia Tech's OMCS program with a specialization of HCI.  
 
 Outside of schooling and work, my I spend my time outside, hiking and playing sports with friends, as well as doing photography.
 
Most of my programming experience is with **React**, **Python**, **Java**, and **C++**

Right now, I am actively working with cross platform mobile developement with **ReactNative**, **Firebase**, **HTML & CSS**

I think I will continue working in the mobile space for my next few projects and want to learn a platform-specific technology like Swift or Kotlin. If you have suggests or insight, please reach out to me below.
    
 My last job expreience was working an internship at Stratos Energy Services in Dublin, Ireland! I am an intern development team lead and outside of that focus on UX and frontend development.

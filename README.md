 Hello! My name is Will McCarten! I am a third year computer science student at the University of Florida. 
 
 I’m interested in just about anything technology related. I would say my main interest lies with web and mobile apps, games, and really any program that 
 a user will interact with. I enjoy both frontend and backend. 
    
 I’m currently building a personal website.

 Anyone can reach out to me on LinkedIn @: https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-mccarten/
 
 Thank you for checking my profile out!
